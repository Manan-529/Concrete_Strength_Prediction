# Concrete_Strength_Prediction
Conducted comparative analysis of multiple regression models for predicting comprehensive strength of concretes.
Implemented Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree Model, Random Forest and Extra-Tree regressor for prediction.
Achieved a prediction accuracy of 95% using 8 constituent material as parameters on Extra-Tree Regressor.
